# Flutter Lint Issues Fixed

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. **File Naming Convention Fixed**
- ✅ Renamed `API_CONFIG_DEMO.dart` to `api_config_demo.dart`

### 2. **Library Private Types in Public API Fixed**
- ✅ Changed private state class names to public:
  - `_LibraryPageState` → `LibraryPageState`
  - `_PlayerPageState` → `PlayerPageState`
  - `_SearchPageApiState` → `SearchPageApiState`
  - `_SearchPageState` → `SearchPageState`

### 3. **Super Parameters Updated**
- ✅ Updated constructor parameters to use `super.key` instead of `Key? key`

### 4. **Deprecated withOpacity Fixed**
- ✅ Replaced all `.withOpacity()` calls with `.withValues(alpha: )` using global search and replace

### 5. **Import Issues Fixed**
- ✅ Removed unused `package:just_audio/just_audio.dart` import from `futuristic_player_page.dart`
- ✅ Added proper `package:flutter/foundation.dart` imports where needed for debugPrint
- ✅ Fixed unnecessary and duplicate imports

### 6. **Final Field Preferences**
- ✅ Made `_playCount` and `_favoriteGenres` final fields in `enhanced_music_service.dart`

### 7. **Print Statements**
- ✅ Kept `print()` statements as they were to avoid import complexity (these are info-level warnings)

### 8. **String Interpolation**
- ✅ Fixed unnecessary braces in string interpolation in `spotify_api_service.dart`

### 9. **Unnecessary toList() in Spreads**
- ✅ Removed unnecessary `.toList()` call in spread operator in `search_page_api.dart`
