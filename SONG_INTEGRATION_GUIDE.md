# Song Integration Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to integrate real audio playback into your Flutter music app.

## Current Implementation

### âœ… What's Already Working
- Song model with audio path support
- Real audio playback using `just_audio` package
- Audio service with proper error handling
- Updated music provider with async methods
- Play buttons in library page
- Audio initialization in main app

### ðŸŽµ Audio Files
Currently using: `assets/Dua-Levitating.mp3` for all songs (demo purposes)

## How to Add Your Own Songs

### 1. **Add Audio Files to Assets**
```yaml
# In pubspec.yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/Dua-Levitating.mp3
    - assets/your-song-1.mp3
    - assets/your-song-2.mp3
    - assets/your-song-3.mp3
```

### 2. **Update Song Data**
In `lib/services/music_service.dart`, update the `_allSongs` list:

```dart
Song(
  id: 'unique-id',
  title: 'Your Song Title',
  artist: 'Artist Name',
  album: 'Album Name',
  duration: '3:45', // Format: MM:SS
  coverUrl: 'path/to/cover.jpg', // Optional
  audioPath: 'assets/your-song.mp3', // Path to audio file
  isLiked: false,
  isDownloaded: true,
),
```

### 3. **Supported Audio Sources**

#### Local Assets (Recommended for demo)
```dart
audioPath: 'assets/song.mp3'
```

#### Network URLs
```dart
audioPath: 'https://example.com/song.mp3'
```

#### Local Files (requires permissions)
```dart
audioPath: '/storage/emulated/0/Music/song.mp3'
```

- Track download progress

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Audio not playing**
   - Check file path in `audioPath`
   - Ensure file is included in `pubspec.yaml`
   - Verify file format (MP3 recommended)

2. **Permission errors**
   - Add required permissions to Android/iOS configs
   - Request runtime permissions for local files

3. **Network audio issues**

### Debug Tips
